Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The main goal of the app I designed was to provide an inventory management system so users could keep track of items they have to make inventory management more effortless. The basic requirements were to have a screen to log in to the app, create a database shell, display that database’s information to the user using a grid, and finally have an SMS notifications system to notify the user about important information.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The most critical screens for this app are the log-in screen, the inventory screen, and the add item screen. These are the most necessary screens to support the user-centered UI. These are the screens that allow the user to use the app to its full capacity and allow them to address their needs. When creating my UI designs, I wanted to make sure each screen was pleasing to the eyes and easy to use. Each one address the users needs and is easy to use with no extra feature to distract the user. For these reasons, I think they succeeded and came together to make my UI useful and pleasing to the user.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

The main approach I tried to use was to be as clear and precise as possible. I try to follow best practices and keep my code as easy to follow and understand as possible. This is a good rule of thumb to follow no matter what type of code I may be creating in the future and I plan on following them in every project I work on. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

The main form of testing I did was using the virtual device within Android Studio and testing to make sure each screen worked as intended. I also used the in app debug feature to notify me of any errors wit in my code. these two forms of testing highlighted any errors I created and allowed me to make sure every aspect of my app functioned correctly. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

The main part I had trouble with during the development process was creating the functionality of the application. The designing of the different screens was pretty easy, but creating code to make them function was the hard part. It was hard to figure out how to design the functionality all on my own and plan out the code accordingly. However I took on the challenge and just tried to take it slow and work through one screen at a time and that seemed to make it less daunting to me so it was easier to eventually have a complete app.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The main thing I am most proud of from my app is the UI design. I am really enjoying the screen design part of app design and was glad I got the chance to flex my artistic talents.
