# CS-360 Project Three Description

This repo contains code from my final project in Mobile Architecture and Programming. This course focused on developing an Android application using Java and Android Studio. In the course, I created a fully functional mobile app, focusing on a user-centered design, database integration (SQLite), and security. The course emphasized mobile development best practices, including UI design, app testing, and debugging. For my final project, the app I designed was an inventory management app that had multiple different app pages, including a login page, an inventory page, and an inventory management page.
